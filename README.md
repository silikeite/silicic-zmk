# silicic-zmk

This is my personal [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) configuration for my [Sweep](httpps://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) using [nice!nano v2](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) controllers (BT main/peripheral setup).

It is based on my old [silicic-qmk](https://github.com/silikeite/silicic-qmk) firmware based on [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), while taking ideas (mainly the hold-tap layers on alphas) from the default Ferris layout [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/user-keymaps-still-present/keyboards/ferris/keymaps/default/readme.md). The left hand has been optimized for my one-handed usecases (with the other hand on the mouse) primarily while coding, drawing, or video editing.

Builds are available in the [actions](https://github.com/silikeite/silicic-zmk/actions) tab of this repo for as long as Github makes them available.
